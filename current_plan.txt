Currently riding through the 3rd night of the world of Sakura, Moyu.

While I can say nothing much about the whole story aspect during this stage, 
but this story's theme is not just a mere fantasy setting, involving magical girls fighting against monster or such.
Instead, I found out it is a "Dark" fantasy engaging in human mind expressed in both creative and disturbing ways.

Although I have tried to write my detailed thoughts regarding Sakura, Moyu, 
about how it portrays the unexpectedly dark fantasy, engaging in human mind creatively and disturbingly. 
Or how (my) Favorite feline loli, kiss you shyly yet innocently is the best thing in the world or such. 
Unfortunately, my happy time with Sakura, Moyu is still shallow (fuck work) 
thus I couldn't come up with anything concrete or creative at all.
So the only thing I can say about Sakura, Moyu right now is "Too Good"

Still, it would be a bit too blunt to stop my thoughts in track right now so let me state its strong&weak point
-  Although the writer paced the story better than Iroseka, 
   his unique slow pace SoL is still can be seen. While it clearly invest time to convey the close relationship between the casts 
   He sometimes emphasized things quite a bit... too much, and that make me yearn for more faster-pace SoL a little bit
   good thing the arts greatly help to not let things get feel too stale   
-  It is one of a few VNs that I intend to read slowly as possible,
   so I can appreciate those beautiful backgrounds and soothing bgms to their full extent.

  Thanks to all staffs & artists who poured their best into this work,
  every visual aspect is one of the best art I have appreciated during recent years, 
  which turns the world & atmosphere into unparallelable immersion.
  and it might be the only work that cause my heart to tremble everytime I arrived at the title screen

I think I might spend more than a month going through this wonderful world,
in order to make sure not to let this feeling fade away easily.
So good luck to all readers who are enjoying inidividual route right now and hope you have a good time.

one of the very few VNs that cause my heart to tremble everytime I arrive at the title screen


good thing
	- every visual aspect is the best art I have appreciated during recent years
	- world & atmosphere immersion is unparallel
	- thanks to all staffs, they really poured their best into this work
	- less obvious, but I think the writer this time carefully balanced thing between SoL/story progress part better than iroseka (and arts obviusly help)
	-  (aka listen to every voiceline without skip and appreciate the bg & bgm)
not so good thing
	- why this work not sell in spring?
	- slow pace... it really invest time to convey the relationship and interaction between characters... 
	  but I guess the writer love to emphasize shit quite a bit... which help to express the importantness in something
	  but at the same time also make me yearn for more faster-pace progress a little bit... although the arts greatly help you not to get feel too stagnant
