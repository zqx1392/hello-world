
so PREVIOUS_POI need to store
OBJECTID (for target), hn, name_id, actualaddress, coorx, coory?
so.... <OBJECTID, STRUCT>

get all NAME_ID from POI_INFO

loop OFFICIAL_NAME
	if OBJECTID == NAME_ID
		record this OBJECTID + NAME

loop POI_INFO again
	if OBJECTID == CHILDPOI
		continue
	if ACTUALADDRESS is not null
		if found in map PREVIOUS_POI and this.HN = that.hn
			if PREVIOUS_POI.OBJECTID don't have in OFFICIAL_NAME
				delete old, and insert new
			else
				continue
	else if this.name_id is  not null
		if this.name_id.name = that.name_id.name and this.hn = that.hn
			if PREVIOUS_POI.OBJECTID don't have in OFFICIAL_NAME
				delete old, and insert new
			else
				continue
	else if HN = PREVIOUS_POI.HN
		if this close to 1 of them
			if PREVIOUS_POI.OBJECTID don't have in OFFICIAL_NAME
				delete old, and insert new
			else
				continue
		else
			insert new
	else
		insert new

input case, and jump to other one... (input keyword, and print series with keyword)

Get list of file from exam.txt, and check if the file still exist in /example/folder or not, then type 1 file per line if not exist
