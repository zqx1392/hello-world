Time to decide how to improve life, seriously

- 15 min write
1. practice speak, by listen to my stupid voice
2. invest... yeah, to prepare for 40+ journey eh
3. Think about how I could expand my IT or programming skill
3. while c++ is a pain in an ass, at least you can summarize about c++ knowledge now
