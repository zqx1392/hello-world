create insert function for last stage (add new records)

input case, and jump to other one... (input keyword, and print series with keyword)
write batch file for one example tool (set list of input)
loop to get every text file in input folder, and copy to destination
Get list of file from exam.txt, and check if the file still exist in /example/folder or not, then type 1 file per line if not exist
