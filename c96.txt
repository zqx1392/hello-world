mistake
c95 - slight mistake at last ready (西1 -> 2)
c95 - big mistake to challenge Izumi while knowing her ridiculous long line
c95 - almost mistake to sell spoil or war after 12/31 (buy price will drop) <- unless you are sure it will be fucking popular
c95 - not mistake but still - unless you want to buy big good, avoid qeueing pro circles like hiten, teinkuru (abundant and last up to 1pm)
c94 - do not bring enough water + shade to hide from sun

don't forget to prioritize based on
- how fast it will be sold out (something you want most might not be the fastest)
- what you want most (small or big, doesn't matter)
- tracable/buyable during post-war or not (also can afford post-war price for big goods?)
- distance between group
