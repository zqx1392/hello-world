The Past
	- A group of abused, neglected children connected together via dream and "桜の樹" and utilize their imagination to give them a peace of mind
	- Thir imagination grew too big and slipped into reality, created terror amongst adults
	- Adults, cultivated by their fear, slaughtered all the children and buried them under "桜の樹"

Origin
	- Time passed
	- Asuza and Tomohito born
	- Asuza, alone, jumped into far future involuntary due to her own curse, and arrived at one point in the future.
	- [1]She picked a girl from "桜の樹" and named her "Mashiro" in order to help building "夜の国" from "桜の樹" so she can travel back into the past and meet Tomohito again.
	- But before completed, Asuza jumped further into the near end of future and saw the moon annihilated humanity
	- She learned how to jump back into the past, and met Mashiro at time[1] again, then completed "夜の国" with the help of Tomohito's song
	 	-> also built with the new propose "to save humanity from the moon"
	- Asuza rode the train back to the past to meet Tomohito, spent immoral yet sweet one year with him, and gave bith to Taiga
	- She inevitably jumped back to [1], taking Taiga with her, and left him at [1] to her artisan cult relative before jumping to far future again.
	:

Taiga's Part
	- grew up in artisan cult, whose belief is to maintain "夜の国" by sacrificing their own children continually.
	- Taiga was ordered to killed Mashiro so the cult could invaded "夜の国" and fulfilled their twisted desires.
	- Taiga met Mashiro, and fell in love together
	- He decided to run away with Mashiro from the cult, using his power to pull her from "夜の国" into physical world, but died by a random stabber halfway
	- He entrusted his power to "the protag" so Mashiro could return to "夜の国" and meet him there
	- However, Mashiro felt strong sympathy with the protag life, tried to bring him back to his mom, but fucked up and badly damaged both souls
	- Mashiro, who could not bear the guilt and escaped the shame to meet Taiga, used her power to become "夜の女王" as a way to punished herself.
	- The protag witnessed many people who care him genuinely, all died and departed from him terribly and left a deep scar in his heart
		-> he blamed his existence as the cause of everything
	- Kuro couldn't just stand and watch anymore, she turned into human form, brought the protag into "夜の国" and found a road to potentially undone all the tragedies
	- Kuro and Taiga rode into [World A] in order to "help" Mashiro

World A
	- Arrived and met Asuza, Tomohito, and all heroines
	- The protag acidentally fulfilled the prophecy and sent Asuza into [Origin] path
	- Kuro shouldered the Asuza's curse from the protag (and Haru) and had to stay in the time room periodically so she could meet the protag again
	- The protag found out Mashiro in "夜の女王" form was beyond help and had to "kill" her instead <- this broke him
	- The protag came up with the worst grand scheme ever as his own extreme punishment(salvation)
		: To become "夜の王" instead of Mashiro and deleted his existence from every world and timeline so Taiga&Mashiro could achieve a happy ending 
	    : For the price, he needed to fulfill all (except Kuro) heroines' wishes and forcefully romanced with them
		: So he could end his life in the worst way possible -> have everyone who once loved him dearly, kill him(夜の王) without mercy, even he himself
	- In order to execute this plan, he went into Chiwa and Hiyori route and created
		: [World A-Chiwa] timeline
		: [World A-Hiyori] timeline
	- Regardless, in Haru route he fucked up and let Haru successfully suicided, thus he need to suicide and jumped into [World B]
	- However, Kuro used her power to follow the protag to [World B] and revived [World A] protag by the cost of her own life
	- The protag and Kuro's (who should be able to revive again using her 9 life) future in this [World A] is unknown... but could possibly lead to the beginning of [Haru past]

Haru Past
	- chronologically around [xxx] years after World A. Unknown origin timeline
	- Haru's mom(遠矢's daughter and 十夜's friend) became mentally ill, tortured and abused Haru
	- The protag rescued Haru, escaped together for a while, and let Haru fall in love wih him
	- Nonetheless, The protag selfishly fulfilled his desire by using Haru as a bait to lure her mom and kill both himself and the mom
		-> 十夜 Who should be able to see how her 2 dearest people killed each other would undoubtedly heartbroken beyond repair
	- Haru blamed the whole incident to herself and strongly believe that she should better die from the beginning than "to meet the protag and cause this tragedy"
	- Haru couldn't overcome this devastation decided to travel to the beginning of [World A]

World B, C, D
	- The Protag failed to save Haru who technically killed herself, had to kill himself again
	- Kuro also repeated the same
	- The protag and Kuro's future in [World B, C, D] are unknown (possibly bad endings)
	- Except World D, Kuro spent 1 of her 9 lives to create additional bullet for The protag to use in [World E]

World E
	| Since the protag successfully shot young Haru back into her own timeline, she didn't come to kill grown up Haru and give plenty of times between the couple to open their minds
	- Haru realized how fucked up the story has become, but she still couldn't forget the past and forgive herself
		-> 	she wants to be with the protag, yet fears to suffer the misfortune by staying with him, 
			and can't stand seeing he makes love to other person than her, hence she chooses to kill himself in order to solve this paradoxical mind
	- The protag gave the chance to Haru to overcome herself, by shooting her and sending her into "時間の墓場"
		-> she tried to alter the past involving her mom, but realized in the end that her mom's fate cannot be changed
		-> Haru had to abandon her mom in the graveyard, and grasped her own new happiness future by jumping into the end of prologue in [World E]
	- Haru found the courage to forgive herself and move on, confessed her love to the protag and archived the happy ending
	- The couple spent their life until old, the protag died and met Kuro in "夜の国"
	- The protag knew everything Kuro had done during [World A - E] via "桜の樹"
	- The protag reaped the results he have done from [World A-Chiwa] [World A-Hiyori] [World E] and successfully altered all the timeline
	 	: [World A] -> [New World A]
		: [Origin] -> [New Origin]
		: [Taiga's Part] -> [New Taiga's Part]
	- The protag deleted his existence from every world and timeline except [New World A] so he (as a child) can kill himself (as "夜の王") 

New World A (the beginning of common route)
	- setting is almost identical to old [World A]
	- but "夜の王" exists instead of "夜の女王" and [New World A] is an endless loop
	- Everytime he "kill himself" a bad ending timeline [World B, C, D] and other unknown shall be erased and put into "時間の墓場" 
	- he desired to loop this world forever as a perfect self-punishment

New Origin & New Taiga's Part
	- Whether the moon is still the threat or "夜の王" became the new threat or not, it won't change the events up to where Taiga died (except Kuro and the protag are not exist at all)
	- Taiga successfully met Mashiro, and spent their life happily
	- Taiga died due to old age, reunite with Mashiro, and knew all the protag's story from "桜の樹"
	- Taiga and Mashiro wanted to rescue the protag, and decided to imitate the protag's life in [World A] so they can understand the protag feeling and a way to help better 
	- Taiga and Mashiro paid the price to create a new body (almost identical to the protag) and rode the train to [World X]

World X (Kuro route)
	- almost identical to [New World A] except that he replaced the protag
		-> Unsure whether Kuro is in this World at all (since Taiga arrived alone)
		-> Still, Taiga can connect to Kuro (from World E) via cellphone and follow the protag's footstep without much trouble
	- Taiga moved forward into Haru route
		-> There is a theory that Taiga NTRed Haru, but since it does not fit Taiga's personality and he doesn't have to do follow everything, the possibility is quite low
		-> Also, it was mentioned that Tomohito failed to crossdress Taiga (while successfully done to the protag)
	- But when Taiga need to suicide, he didn't have enough willpower to pull the trigger, delayed it until he turned into adult and forgot everything about "夜の国"
	- (The beginning of Kuro route) Kuro called Taiga and made him remember everything from [Origin] to [World X]
	- Taiga somehow successfully shot himself and jumped into [World Y] in order to begin "Protag Rescue Operation"

World Y
	- Start as same as [World X]
	- Taiga explained everything to all characters involved, seeking cooperation from them. Everyone agreed to help Taiga
	- Here's the plan to rescue the protag
		1. Interrupt the protag in [World A-E] and have him stop the whole grand scheme
		2. Find something to persuade the protag and have him abandon the whole grand scheme
	- Taiga tried 1. by sending young Haru into [World B, C, D]. Unfortunately young Haru is not Haru who already overcame herself from [World E] so she couldn't forgive her self yet
		-> she killed herself(grown up Haru) 3 times in total before got shot in [World D] and returned to [World Y] with deep bullet wound
	- Meanwhile, Taiga ask Kuro to find 2. but killed by her self nightmare when she discovered the protag's hope
	- Taiga used his gun to shoot "夜の王"(the protag) to send Haru's message to the protag's mind
		-> the protag finally forgave himself and conceded Taiga&Mashiro and "夜の国" problems to Taiga&Mashiro (so they can solve later in FD?)
	- The protag now realized how much Kuro have suffered and wished to make Kuro a happy ending 
	- By using the bullet power, He traveled back to the past where he held hope most, thus arriving in [World Z]

World Z
	- branched from [World A] during prologue
	- The protag romanced Kuro
	- Haru used her wished to forget everthing about the protag so she wouldn't think about killing herself anymore
	- The protag wanted to grant Kuro wish, and her wish is
		> become the same creature, spent the same time, living the same life as the protag
	- The protag paid the price by living alone throughout his life without ever forgetting Kuro (and without Kuro knowing), both suffered hardship in their life to some degree
	- The protag reincarnate together with Kuro in [World End]

World End
	- Taiga&Mashiro somehow solved the problems and reincarnated as young couple
		> gave birth to reincarnated Asahi, Tooya, and the protag
	- The protag and Kuro are together from the childhood, until adolescent
	- Now that the new spring has arrived, their true happiness shall start from now on...

Plot holes?
	- how time theory really work in this story?
		-> lots of branched timeline and alternate dimension with "夜の国" as the bridge to connect all possibilities
