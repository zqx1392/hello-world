Last week I've finished [Rance9](https://vndb.org/v13802) due to the recent announcement of RanceX.
If Rance7 is held in high regard by its engaging gameplay with some interesting dialogs inbetween, 
Rance9 takes the opposite direction and drives the story gallantly with its simple yet fitting gameplay to keep active brain in touch.
The synopsis is pretty much straightforward; Rance wants to uncurse frozen Sill using the artifact lied in Helman capital's castle, 
but he also wants to fuck Helman's young empress, Sheila, in order to achieve the title of grand ruler fucker(Lia, Magic, Sheila, and soon to ripe Kouhime).
Theoretically, without immense plot armor Rance couldn't pull off this stunt alone,
so he join Patton's rebelion and lead the formidable group toward Helman revolution. 
Unlike the time during Urza's resistance, Rance really aims his eyes toward the capital and steady advance his group step-by-step with minimal detour, 
not wasting times to literally fuck around like he usually did. 
Besides, seeing Rance breaking obstacles eagerly is far more pleasant than seeing Rance breaking unwilling women's virginitiy anytime, to be honest.
It also makes the adventure focus on more battles and strategics than environments and world building which lead to battle-oriented story - 
it becomes much more intense and gives plenty of space for solid narration, which in turn let natural flow rolls the wheel smoothly.
Suffice to say, Rance9 is a great counterpart to Rance7 in term of story and gameplay. 

Still, the story will not stand by itself without the reinforcement of prominent characters. 
Thanks to the hard-learned lesson from Rance8, the casts now have sufficient screen time and receive respectable role to exercise their charisma. 
It's so refreshing to see Lelyukov, Aristoles, Rolex, Patton show how cool, sexy men can be when they're in action.
I actually like them more than most girls and they give me enough reasons to throw in high affection points. (No homo though) 
Meanwhile, all new girls such as Miracle, Sheila really become strong contenders against all time favorites Shizuka and Kanami with their unique personality.
For other characters, they have proved themselves regardless of their morality and left striking impression on me - especially ambitious Mirneva. 

Not only the story and casts have become better and more matured. Erotic part also riped it fruits - mainly for Kanami and Shizuka.
Even though it's a bit forced on how Kanami's tsun easily broken down abruptly, 
but god damn I must admit I had never found Kanami become attractive this much until Rance9. 
Her dere wass absolutely awesome and [the lovely face she made](https://i.imgur.com/E6f1aeQ.png) when Rance coaxed her beautifully penetrated my moe-threshold.
[Her panic face was also gorgeous too.](https://i.imgur.com/zVys0hV.png)
Not to mention her H-scenes in which she tried her best to pleasure Rance. Definitely fappable.
In the same time, Rance was willing enough to be more gentle with strong-willed Shizuka, 
she slowly fell for Rance while accomplished such erotic H-scene. The face she made during second H-scene was truly a sight to see. 
Sadly for Senhime and Miracle, my two most favorites, to be received some half-rape half-torture H treatments from Rance.
I hope Rance10 will give them a bit more gentle --kiss-- H for once.

Of course, nothing can be gained without some loss. Rance9 has to trade off their potential massive play time and replay value from the gameplay,
due to the fact that all battle maps are mostly "fixed". To simply put it, 
I will always face same enemies, in a same turn, with a same strategy. (target squishy characters first)
It's not hard to figure out a strong suit for each battle and the more time I spent in Rance9, the easier later maps have become.
Meanwhile, most of power come from equippable items that drop at the end of each battle, from which 
can bring imbalance to characters or negate their weak point completely(+120 hp, +30% crits rate, no miss).
For me, It feels more like Utawarerumono than a typical Rance game and I can hardly find inspiration to dwell into a new challenge after first playthrough.

In overall, strong plot and narration, atrractive characters as usual with men become more prominent, short gameplay, rock BGMs, and real nice H-scenes.
So yes, It's not exaggerate to say Rance9 is the most exciting story I've played throughtout the whole series (yet)
Perhaps I will jump to Rance1 and 3 remake next before take a final leap to Rance10

In other news, I also fap to [Koikuma](https://vndb.org/v17515) . I must to admit that Sayori's artwork is a very good side-dish.

When you do pullups, try to imagine yourself pulling your elbows down, not pulling your body up. It's a mental trick that can make them feel easier, because it forces you to use the muscles in your back more.
