Finally finished Hiyori and Chiwa routes, so about halfway through the madness world of Sakura, Moyu.

Honestly, I really want to give detailed thoughts 
about how it does not hesitate to proudly represent gay couples and show the intimacy they shared upon midnight in the desert handsomely. 
Or how it portrays coming-of-age teenagers who have mild suicidal thoughts and tendencies tediously yet beautifully.
Or perhaps how several-decade-old loli beg you to take shower&sleep together earnestly with teary eyes, is the most destructive thing I have found in the universe.
However, I might end up rambling around too long and tilt someone in the process, just like how Sakura Moyu almost successfully triggered me twice, thus I will try to keep things as short as possible.

To begin with, 
I usually treat good VNs like drinks: Gulping down sweet moege sugary drinks swiftly like a true Moebuta,
occasionally drink nukige like a mineral water,
 and enjoy slowly sipping and appreciating kamige like a great wine. 
 However, Sakura Moyu can only be described as a very strong wine, 
with a truly pecuilar taste: not too exciting, nor much thrilling, and neither exactly romance, just a pure, raw text(ure) of plots and emotions, whose intensity could crush my brain anytime.

Of course the scenario is indeed delicious and so intoxicating. 
But when things get heated it is hard to maintain my healthy drinking pace, especially during chiwa route; 
When the presumed climax showdown kicked off, 
the most intense yet tedious conversation between 2 people took place almost 30 minutes in real life. the only I saw was Text, text, and more text.... nothing else at all
I knew it gradually destroy my brain and turn everything into illegible texts but who care it's going to end anyways so let become drunk
Here's the kicker: The real climax is in 3-4 hours later with more repeated scenes cut in between. 

I knew I unconsciously drank too fast, and ended up making my brain seriously drunk and drown into the pool of texts. 
before I could even notice, I couldn't feel the taste anymore. I really wanted to finish it fast no matter how much it burn my brain out, 
but at same time I realized that if I forcefully gulp it down, not tasting it at all, all it lefts will be pukes, headaches, and a bad taste lingered in my mind afterward.

so here the choice that I made after the standdown. I give my brain a break, clear my head, open my mind, and don't care anymore whenever the story will come to the end sooner or later.

The resume after the long reset really enlighthen me that while Sakura Moyu's pace is, without a doubt, horrendous.
But if you can work around that fatal point and adjust your pace to compensate, all it left is nothing but a blissful taste. 
I can certainly say that the real climax was the best moment indeed. 
However, if I decided to finish it in one go instead, I'm pretty sure that the only taste I feel at the end would be bitter.
 All in all, the endings really gave me an extraordinary heartwarming feeling that is going last few days. 
but the pace also gave me temporary brain damage too. 
To anyone reading this work. Take a rest regularly, and do not rush, or it will crush you.
