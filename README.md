Finally finished Hiyori and Chiwa routes, and reached the halfway of Sakura, Moyu.

Honestly, I really want to give detailed thoughts about how it did not hesitate to represents gay couples right and show the true intimacy they shared upon the midnight desert handsomely.
. Or how it portrays coming-of-age teenager's minds with mild suicidal tendencies tediously yet beautifully
. Or perhaps how 100-year-old loli beg you to take a shower&sleep together earnestly with teary eyes, is the most destructive thing I have found in the universe.
However, It might end up too long and make someone tilted just like how Sakura Moyu almost triggered me twice, so let me write a review how reading it truly feel 
I will try to keep things as short as possible.

To start off, 
I usually treat good VNs like good drinks; Gulping down sweet moege sugary drinks swiftly like a true Moebuta, 
or enjoy slowly sipping and appreciating kamige like a great wine, --and sometimes drink nukige like a water--. 
However, Sakura Moyu can only be described as a very strong wine, with truly pecuilar taste: not too exciting, nor much thrilling, and neither exactly romance, 
just a pure, raw texts(sssss) of emotions and plots whose intensity could wasted my brain anytime.

While I can maintain my slow pace in order to taste its healtily in most cases, the epic volume and the strong alcohol sometimes become too much to handle.
Particularly the presumed standdown climax between 2 guys in chiwa route that consist only talking, talking, and talking
that last 20 minute (but the real climax is 3 hours after)
that part drain conciousness and concentration away, gradually grinding down my will to read it properly, but somehow I just... couldn't stop.
because The scenario is indeed delicious and so alluring, I really just want to finish it no matter how much it burn my brain out
but, how much unintelligible texts it has become I know I'm not gonna enjoy it anymore...

I realized that if I forcefully gulp it down, not taste it, all it will give me in the end are gonna be pukes, headaches, and a bad taste lingered in your mind.
give it a break, go out for a walk, and refresh your mind.....

and sometimes the repeated scene almost tilted me
Nonetheless, the endings really gave me extraordinary heartwarming that is going last few days
so to summarize thing up... if you are deep into an individual route, just don't rush, or it will crush you.
