pangolin : javelin instead of fury (for now) + find more mana regen (bottle?)

serach sapporo gyuya, search sapporo for p'hug

This week I've finished Rance9 in correspond to the announcement of RanceX.
If Rance7 is an engaging gameplay-focused game with some interesting story between, 
Rance9 took the opposite direction and drive the story gallantly with its simple yet fun enough gameplay as break-in.
Although I didn't intend to rush Rance9 the story is truly engaging and gameplay element serve the plot driven pretty well.
different from previous rance series; The series has become matured and the story step itself up to another level. 
It also learn the mistake from Rance8 and make things right; To give each character to excercise their strength and charisma and let them heat up both the story and erotic resonantly.
It's not exgregrate to say that Rance9 hold the solid, yet engaging storyline in the whole series (yet).
Even though it's a bit forced how Kanami's tsun easily broken down abruptly but god damn
I must admit I'd never find Kanami attractive that much until Rance9. Her dere is awfully cute since she shower her lovely face when Rance tease her which exceed my moe-threshold without much effort.
In the same time, strong-spirited Shizuka show how erotic Rance can do if they're willing enough.

When you do pullups, try to imagine yourself pulling your elbows down, not pulling your body up. It's a mental trick that can make them feel easier, because it forces you to use the muscles in your back more.
