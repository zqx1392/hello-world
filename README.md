1. change sub-district + text to constant value
2. make connection between postal and district
3. wedge number <- if <50% = 10 , 50-70% = 20, 70-100% = 30

I agree that the writing might play a part in overall bad pacing, but I think the biggest problem is "overabundance of quality"
From what I've played so far (3 routes except Kuro's), each route can easily replace a true route in other VNs easily due to the sheer force of length, emotions, and plots
However, the stories themselve are very serious; It is so natural to quickly drain readers' concentration and desensitize them against overwhelming emotions in no time. 
(not to mention that long text tilts readers easier)
Sadly, there is no proper "emotional padding" relax scene/route to let our guard down at all during long serious sequences, 
so some of us who couldn't bear it anymore simply "fuck this shit" and quitted the game, 
or skimmed through some parts instead and lost any sympathy for what the writer was trying to convey in the process.
Maybe it might be better to have typical routes similar to Sakuuta rather than non to give readers a much needed breathing room and prepare their mind for the true route better, but oh well,
guess it's time for me to get back to reading.
