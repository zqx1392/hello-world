The thing which impress me most is the straight-forwardness. 
Unlike previous journeys where Rance would literally fuck around and roaming half of the time before the main stories moved forward,
This one has concise startup and never miss a beat to make the story jump toward the goal.
Every chapter is about how Rance marched his trusty companions toward the capital.


Still, the story won't stand by itself without reinforcement of attractive characters. 
The story launch forward steady and make great care to introduce each charcter tenderly.
And no matter how much new characters roles are Rance9 gave sufficient cast time to prove themselve in their own way regardless of their morality. which in turn give memoriable scenes. 
And that's the reason why even though there's rather huge cast of characters (40+), most of their face and action still vivid in my mind.  .
Meanwhile, you can see the development from main chacters (perhaps except Rance); from unlucky to lovely, from angrily to tenderly. and from weak royal to true ruler.

When you do pullups, try to imagine yourself pulling your elbows down, not pulling your body up. It's a mental trick that can make them feel easier, because it forces you to use the muscles in your back more.
