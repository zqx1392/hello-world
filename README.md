It's been a long time since I've posted anything in this thread due to the tide of fate spirals my petty life throughout last 6 months. Currently I've found my way and settled down in northern part of Japan during this winter. It’s quite cold compared to my homeland but overall happy to be able to be here. Still, While working my ass off in order to feed more VNs and surviving daily blizzard I asked myself "Why don't ya prick pick a appreciate VN for this season?" Well, without any objection against that thought I salvaged my dusty snowy mountainous pile of backlog. When my eyes fixed upon AstralAir I knew this gonna be good.

The beginning gave me a good chill as they protrayed the winter atmosphere quite well (and Hokkaido clock tower to immerse me more). With a foreshadow mystery right from the beginning and four lolis to enjoy I started to feel good about this. Not to mentin Ochiba and Rinne's personality which are much captivated (in their own breast size way). Though, with ESP/Magic superpower thing strucked me a weird feeling of how the story will unfold since I knew Favorite is good with moege stuff but concern how Favorite will handle Combat part as well as that. And with a few action scenes during the common route involving helping people without a conflict I can't help but "expectant" when real crashing combat begins. But as far as mystery part go smoothly and moege runs beautifully I was having fun nonetheless.

It also surprised me a bit when the common route end abruptly after 3 action encounters without any intimacy scenes between Riku and Yuuki. In my opinion I just want more scenes for the two so I could feel their feeling better before entering true route.

Ochiba, her route is quite vanilla and has steady development throughout the route. Personally I found the climax decent enough which make the aftermath [ero] romance feels pretty good. The chemistry between the two is not too bad either and it makes their sweetness relationship lingers in my mind for a while.

Kotori&Ichika, not my favorite routes since they focus more on family matters and contribute almost less to none for the overall story. In fact I dislike the way they use superpower mainly for romantic propose rather than creating an intense, serious fight. Nonetheless, their relationship flows feels natural enough to convey the feeling that Riku and the girl love each other well.

Corona, is the best wild ride route in which it fucked my expectation up every ways. Since I've disappointed in the use of power in Kotori&Ichika routes I didn’t anticipate at all when Corona is reveal not to be robot and went full Godmode. At that time I just went from inactive retard reader mode to WTF mode real quick. And when they decide to go full space exploration it unexpectedly knocked me off the chair. Finally, when Riku releases himself and go full Saiyan at the end it just made me flipped my notebook 360. Bravo.

Rinne, definitely my most favorite from the beginning to the end. Although her route is nothing as wild as Corona or as sweet as Ochiba I’m very happy as the way Rinne has become as the end.(perverted half sister, but why not?)

True route(Yuuki). Was expected this to be as good as Hoshimemo's true route or better. However, with the way Favourtie wrapped thing up for other heroines so conveniently in early part and the way they smoothen things a bit too far in the middle I lost momentum to feel the climax. But the climax was excuted much better (and less problematic) than Hoshimemo and the OP gave me a goosebump.

In conclusion, my Affection for each route and heroines are as follows,
Character : Rinne > Ochiba > Corona > Yuuki > Kotori > Ichika
Story : Corona >= Yuuki > Ochiba > Rinne > Kotori >= Ichika

One letdown thing though, Action. I could described it as being Jedis but instead of fighting against Sith Lord they instead use Lightsabers to giraffe the wall saying I luv you babe and then use the force to hold each other. Couldn't help but felt my expectation somehow got backlashed. 

Still, this VN is pretty good for this time of the year and fulfilled my feeling of first snow in my life. I might as well return reading Clannad after getting off tracked for half a year or go on to Oukasabaki.
