Tried to write good things about Sakumoyu/Subahibi at first before reading Sakuuta next, but the supposed mood-refreshing read
Trinoline pissed me off so much, thus my angrily compulsive rant was born.

To put it simply, it tried to be a serious story, but it did not try to tell the story seriously at all.

Why? because judging by the cover, we could get plenty of life-and-death-drama/tearjerking/meaningful AI debate related writing gold materials from the sypnosis alone,
and yes Trinoline attempted to explore about these sensitive topics to some extent.
But hell it's like Minori spent all of their monies on their -big-bang-boobs- beautiful arts and superior production, and decided to not pay the writers enough to write things or something,
so the scenes and dialogs in general can be mockingly presented as below. 
	>A beautiful morning
		P-kun and B-chan walking to school together while practically talking about nothing for 2 minutes.
	>Abruptly skipped to night
		C-san hints to P-kun about something during 1 minute conversation (then throw that hint away into oblivion)
	>Bluntly skipped to next day
		"hello, P-kun. Oh nothing just want to see your pretty dick. See you then!" 
	>Curtly skipped to next evening
		"Hey A-kun I want to discuss about a serious topic, but we only have 2 minutes so lol sux it"
This style is repeated forever, from the beginning till the end.
It inevitably disrupts the harmonious flow, despite (overly) well done presentation and I couldn't build up any profound emotion at all when everything paced so haphazardly.

To rub salt into the wound, the protagonist, who was supposed to bring balance to the force and turn the table, 
instead flipped the table with his 1-dimension nice guy personality and acted more like a true emotionless -transistor- robot than his kawaii moe android sister. 
He could accept anything heroines tried to screw him over without much resistance, meanwhile his perfectly stable emotion can be concisely described as below.
	Someone forcefully replaces his sweet memories about drowned dead sister with a bloated boobs android? I sleep.
	Somehow have an amnesia and explained that his beloved, but bloated sister was dead for a long time already? I sleep.
	An heroine took advantage of his amnesia and tried to trick him into her boyfriend, not caring much about his feeling? I sleep.
	A grown up antagonist tries to be honest with his highly ambitious, yet respectable ideal? REAL SHIT.
	-Boobs? REAL SHIT.-
Nonetheless, he made all heroines fall in love with him illogically by showering all heroines with his hollow kindness and a handful of cum without much effort.
WTF.

Even though I appreciated Trinoline's true ambition to capture the feel from film and trying to be as cinematic as possible,
but Minori fundamentally fucked up by pacing the story in FULL TERMINATOR MODE even though the story is centered around delicate dramas.
Furthermore, in every dramatic scene I felt that they did not really wish to drag conversations too long or debate complicated topics too deep,
so instead they tried to shorten down dialogs as possible and turned it into very straightforward storytelling (to put it nicely)
Of course, it backfired miserably and the story failed to convey anything impactful to me at all.
Hell, if this work clearly indicates itself as moege/nukige the writing and pacing might be toleratable for me. 
However, they half-assedly tried to create a serious story, and that seriously triggered me. 

Granted, reading Trinoline directly after finishing great VNs might skewed my baseline expectation quite a bit
But at least I now understand why Minori has gone, to its graveyard. 


I agree that the writing might play a part in overall bad pacing, but I think the biggest problem is "overabundance of quality"
From what I've played so far (3 routes except Kuro's), each route can easily replace a true route in other VNs easily due to the sheer force of length, emotions, and plots
However, the stories themselve are very serious; It is so natural to quickly drain readers' concentration and desensitize them against overwhelming emotions in no time. 
(not to mention that long text tilts readers easier)
Sadly, there is no proper "emotional padding" relax scene/route to let our guard down at all during long serious sequences, 
so some of us who couldn't bear it anymore simply "fuck this shit" and quitted the game, 
or skimmed through some parts instead and lost any sympathy for what the writer was trying to convey in the process.
Maybe it might be better to have typical routes similar to Sakuuta rather than non to give readers a much needed breathing room and prepare their mind for the true route better, but oh well,
guess it's time for me to get back to reading.

sakura... moyu... although almost everyone acknowledge the story as just a "sacrifice game"
but the thing the writer want to tell to everyone is not about sacrifice at all
it's about "forgiving oneself, live, and spend one life for other people"

you see, the main reason every main charcter seem to sacrifice themselve for is because
"they cannot forgive their past grievous mistake, possibly get over their past losts"

maybe you cant empathy with their ridiculous pessimism or whatever,
but I once experience this shit and understand it too well.
that you have to bear with the heavy sin for your whole life, so if I can choose a choice between suicide,
having your self-hatred rotting your mind away, 
or sacrifice yourself in hope for better result and make your guilty thought stop completely, why not latter?

now you might realize by now but behind "beautiful sacrifice"
is just an ugly truth about characters who cant forgive themselve and want to atone themselve by suffering
in their own punishment, so its nothing you can call it beautiful about, even a bit.

and this work exactly show that sometimes you need the help of the others to move on,
maybe you also have to forget and even abandon the problem in order to gain self happiness.
(just like how Haru had to left her mom forever inside 時間の墓場 to seek new happiness in new timeline
, or how fake Taiga need to abandon his great-sacrifice plan for the sake of Kuro )

Nonetheless, if you are feeling down and can't forgive yourself for whatever reason,
seek forgiveness from other people, and especially oneself, and live to the fullest to atone that feeling.
