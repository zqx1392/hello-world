Tried to write good things about Sakumoyu/Subahibi at first, but Trinoline pissed me off so much so here go.

it tried to be a serious story, but it did not try to tell the story seriously at all.

Like, you could get a plenty of life-and-death-drama/tearjerking/AI-related writing gold materials from the sypnosis alone.
But hell it's like Minori spent all of their monies on their -big-boobs- beautiful arts and superior production but did not pay the writers enough or something.
So the scenes and dialogs in general are: 
Morning : A-kun and B-chan have 2 minutes talk about nothing in particular
Skip to night : A-kun talks to C-san and hints about something within 1 minute conversation (later revealed as nothing significant)
Skip to next day : "hello, kouhai-kun. Oh nothing just want to see your pretty dick. See you then!" 
Skip to evening : "Hey A-kun I want to discuss about a serious topic, but we only have 2 minutes so lol fuck it"
This style was repeated forever. From the beginning till the end.
Even though the story is centered around life-and-death-drama. THERE IS NO FLASHBACK, ALMOST-ZERO MEANINGFUL SELF-DIALOG, AND NONEXISTENT PROPER EMOTIONAL BUILD UP AT All
//They also inserted tearjerking scenes whenever they pleased, and many plot devices were created on the fly.
Even worse, in every dramatic scene I felt that they did not really want to drag conversation too long or discuss about human/AI emotion too deep,
so instead they tried to cut down text as possible and turned into very straightforward storytelling (to put it nicely) or blunt and curted storytelling.
Of course, it backfired miserably becuase the story failed to convey anything impactful to me at all.
Hell, if the story clearly indicated itself as moege/nukige the writing and pacing might be toleratable. 
However, they half-assedly tried to create a serious story, and that seriously triggered me. 

Granted, reading Trinoline directly after finishing great VNs might skewed my baseline expectation a bit
But at least I understand why Minori is gone by now. 


I agree that the writing might play a part in overall bad pacing, but I think the biggest problem is "overabundance of quality"
From what I've played so far (3 routes except Kuro's), each route can easily replace a true route in other VNs easily due to the sheer force of length, emotions, and plots
However, the stories themselve are very serious; It is so natural to quickly drain readers' concentration and desensitize them against overwhelming emotions in no time. 
(not to mention that long text tilts readers easier)
Sadly, there is no proper "emotional padding" relax scene/route to let our guard down at all during long serious sequences, 
so some of us who couldn't bear it anymore simply "fuck this shit" and quitted the game, 
or skimmed through some parts instead and lost any sympathy for what the writer was trying to convey in the process.
Maybe it might be better to have typical routes similar to Sakuuta rather than non to give readers a much needed breathing room and prepare their mind for the true route better, but oh well,
guess it's time for me to get back to reading.

sakura... moyu... although almost everyone acknowledge the story as just a "sacrifice game"
but the thing the writer want to tell to everyone is not about sacrifice at all
it's about "forgiving oneself, live, and spend one life for other people"

you see, the main reason every main charcter seem to sacrifice themselve for is because
"they cannot forgive their past grievous mistake, possibly get over their past losts"

maybe you cant empathy with their ridiculous pessimism or whatever,
but I once experience this shit and understand it too well.
that you have to bear with the heavy sin for your whole life, so if I can choose a choice between suicide,
having your self-hatred rotting your mind away, 
or sacrifice yourself in hope for better result and make your guilty thought stop completely, why not latter?

now you might realize by now but behind "beautiful sacrifice"
is just an ugly truth about characters who cant forgive themselve and want to atone themselve by suffering
in their own punishment, so its nothing you can call it beautiful about, even a bit.

and this work exactly show that sometimes you need the help of the others to move on,
maybe you also have to forget and even abandon the problem in order to gain self happiness.
(just like how Haru had to left her mom forever inside 時間の墓場 to seek new happiness in new timeline
, or how fake Taiga need to abandon his great-sacrifice plan for the sake of Kuro )

Nonetheless, if you are feeling down and can't forgive yourself for whatever reason,
seek forgiveness from other people, and especially oneself, and live to the fullest to atone that feeling.
