don't forget to 
- travel to south, eat ramen and other restaurant
- to flea market near morioka (sat only?)

now
- time to seriously listen jap and capture pitch 
- 取り組む日本？ (新しい単語ー＞創意工夫になろうー＞記録するー＞ぎこちないところを退治するー＞繰り返す)
- 会話　聞き流し　チャットルーム

sat
time to do thai curry again

sun
eat new ramen or teishoku place
chilly shrimp

td weekend
1- cook nasu
1- cook chahan?
3- prepare haru travel plan

improve myself
- learn programming, python, and new tech 
- improve japanese... better speaking and listening -> perhaps I should do when I bored

Fulfill life
e- have fun at the moment
e- build up my body slowly
e- looking forward to sakura
e- vn
h- watch the star

you can assume that all heroines (except kuro) are distantly related cousins
still, Chiwa's stepdad is Haru's granddad....
so theoretically Chiwa is Haru's STEP-AUNT

I agree that the writing might play a part in overall bad pacing, but I think the biggest problem is "overabundance of quality"
From what I've played so far (3 routes except Kuro's), each route can easily replace a true route in other VNs easily due to the sheer force of length, emotions, and plots
However, the stories themselve are very serious; It is so natural to quickly drain readers' concentration and desensitize them against overwhelming emotions in no time. 
(not to mention that long text tilts readers easier)
Sadly, there is no proper "emotional padding" relax scene/route to let our guard down at all during long serious sequences, 
so some of us who couldn't bear it anymore simply "fuck this shit" and quitted the game, 
or skimmed through some parts instead and lost any sympathy for what the writer was trying to convey in the process.
Maybe it might be better to have typical routes similar to Sakuuta rather than non to give readers a much needed breathing room and prepare their mind for the true route better, but oh well,
guess it's time for me to get back to reading.
