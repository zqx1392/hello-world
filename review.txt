I suppose everyone will only present popular osts from well known works and inevitably provide nothing refreshing.
So please allow me, a string&wing instrumentals bgm sentimentalist with an avid interest in 2D pornography,
to introduce obscure pieces (mainly from Nukiges) whose melodies stir pure ecstasy right into my fragile brain.

1. DUO+1 (Sisters : composer Szak, same guy from subahibi [Yoru no Himawari])
Personally one of the best osts amongst my vn career.
Although it has been used in only one occasion during the whole story
(halfly splitted into 2 scenes, to be more precise), 
this beautiful duo absolutely strucked into my heart and still periodically provides
the irreplacible euphoria until this very day.
2. DESIR (Sono Shuuhen : composer Arte Refact)
Similar to DUO+1, this piece has been used exactly once but I did not taste it full glory 
until I accidentally discovered its whole existence from the soundtrack collection.
Still, it never fails to pumps up my pulse rate when a suitable occasion arises with its gallant melodies.
3. whatever you want to (Tsuma Shibori : composer SHADE&NEY)
At first I did not hold any striking impression about this bgm at all, 
but the more I listen the more I fell into this voluptuous maze of melodies.
At the present, it proudly paved its way into Pavlovian response for my dick.
※Really recommend this game for newcomer nukiger (untranslated however).

Of course, my collection does not limit to those and anything from Mizutsuki Ryou, I've, szak, MANYO, and Shinobu are always welcome.

I agree that the writing might play a part in overall bad pacing, but I think the biggest problem is "overabundance of quality"
From what I've played so far (3 routes except Kuro's), each route can easily replace a true route in other VNs easily due to the sheer force of length, emotions, and plots
However, the stories themselve are very serious; It is so natural to quickly drain readers' concentration and desensitize them against overwhelming emotions in no time. 
(not to mention that long text tilts readers easier)
Sadly, there is no proper "emotional padding" relax scene/route to let our guard down at all during long serious sequences, 
so some of us who couldn't bear it anymore simply "fuck this shit" and quitted the game, 
or skimmed through some parts instead and lost any sympathy for what the writer was trying to convey in the process.
Maybe it might be better to have typical routes similar to Sakuuta rather than non to give readers a much needed breathing room and prepare their mind for the true route better, but oh well,
guess it's time for me to get back to reading.

sakura... moyu... although almost everyone acknowledge the story as just a "sacrifice game"
but the thing the writer want to tell to everyone is not about sacrifice at all
it's about "forgiving oneself, live, and spend one life for other people"

you see, the main reason every main charcter seem to sacrifice themselve for is because
"they cannot forgive their past grievous mistake, possibly get over their past losts"

maybe you cant empathy with their ridiculous pessimism or whatever,
but I once experience this shit and understand it too well.
that you have to bear with the heavy sin for your whole life, so if I can choose a choice between suicide,
having your self-hatred rotting your mind away, 
or sacrifice yourself in hope for better result and make your guilty thought stop completely, why not latter?

now you might realize by now but behind "beautiful sacrifice"
is just an ugly truth about characters who cant forgive themselve and want to atone themselve by suffering
in their own punishment, so its nothing you can call it beautiful about, even a tiny fraction of bit.

and this work exactly show that sometimes you need the help of the others to move on,
maybe you also have to forget and even abandon the problem in order to gain self happiness.
(just like how Haru had to left her mom forever inside 時間の墓場 to seek new happiness in new timeline
, or how fake Taiga need to abandon his great-sacrifice plan for the sake of Kuro )

Nonetheless, if you are feeling down and can't forgive yourself for whatever reason,
seek forgiveness from other people, and especially oneself, and live to the fullest to atone that feeling.
